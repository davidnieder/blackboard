##About

Blackboard is a small blogging software powered by python, sqlite and the [flask framework](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask).
It is designed for posting small snippets from the web like videos, images, audio files or just links not for publishing large texts.

I do not recommend installing blackboard on a public system. It is not nearly finished or in a stable state and there are several security issues I have not dealt with yet.

##Requirements

* Apache with mod_wsgi (or another web server)
