##About

Blackboard is a small blogging software written in python, powered by the
[flask microframework](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask). It is designed
for posting small snippets from the web like videos, images, audio files or
just links not for publishing large texts.


##Installation

Currently there is no stable release of Blackboard. It is still under
development. Therefore, I do not recommend installing Blackboard on a public
system.
See the file INSTALL for a list of dependencies and installation instructions.
You can also test Blackboard on your local machine.


##Further plans

* search function
* email notification
* rss/atom feed
* i18n
* second theme
